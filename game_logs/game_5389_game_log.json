Player 4 has been very vocal about targeting Player 5, which could be an attempt to deflect suspicion from themselves.

Let's take a closer look at the speeches made so far.  Player 5, you mentioned the need to be strategic and analyze each other's statements. However, you didn't provide any specific insights or suspicions. This could be a tactic to blend in without drawing attention.  Player 6, your speech was almost identical to Player 5's, which raises a red flag. It seems like an attempt to echo safe statements without contributing anything new.  Given the current situation, I believe Player 6 is trying to play it safe and avoid suspicion. Therefore, I suggest we vote to eliminate Player 6. This will bring us one step closer to victory."
