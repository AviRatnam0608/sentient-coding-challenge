As a villager, my goal is to contribute to the discussion and help us win this game. I'm not trying to stir up drama or create confusion among our ranks.

Let's consider the possibility that player 2 is telling the truth. If they are the seer, they have valuable information that can help us identify the werewolves. Instead of targeting player 2, I suggest we look at the players who have been pushing hard to eliminate them. This could be a tactic by the werewolves to get rid of a key player.  Player 1 was the first to accuse player 2, and players 4, 5, and 6 quickly jumped on board. This coordinated effort to target player 2 seems suspicious to me. We should be wary of players who are too eager to eliminate someone without solid evidence.  I propose we take a closer look at players 1, 4, 5, and 6. Let's gather more information and see if we can find any inconsistencies in their stories. We need to be strategic and not let the werewolves manipulate us into making hasty decisions.
